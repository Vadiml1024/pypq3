## Notes

- Tests should maintain the current mocking strategy to ensure fast execution
- Focus on testing protocol correctness rather than cryptographic primitive correctness
- Prioritize tests that validate security properties and protocol invariants
- Consider adding property-based tests for complex state transitions
- Ensure tests remain maintainable as the codebase evolves
